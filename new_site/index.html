    	<p>hello everyone,</p>
	    <p>I found this site hard to maintain (partially because I made it without consideration to use css/js) and I am planning to revamp it to be more compact and easier to edit.</p>
	    <p>I don't know when I'll start to actually make the site but when I get around to it, hopefully I'll put a button down below that guides people to the new site </p>
	    <p>(I also might experiment a bit)</p>
